## Submission Instructions

### Overview

I have gone on several international trips where it took lots of planning and organizing- but it was difficult to keep track of everything all in one place.

I want to build an application where I can keep track of destinations, plane tickets, train tickets, hotels, tours, attractions, restaurants, with links, maps, other info, etc. Within the app, I will be able to add, edit, delete, or just save some trip ideas all in one place.

The app will be a personal trip planner and organizer. A user will have all of their trip itinerary all in one place. The user can log in, and can add different cities. Within one location, the user can add scheduled events (with links and/or pdfs available), potential sights or attractions (with google maps incorporated).

### Features

**User Login:**
Create account, log in, profile page.
**Customize Trip:**
The user will have the ability to:

- add and delete destination cities
- add and delete activities within each destination
- upload travel doc pdfs
- add notes
- save transportation info
- save hotel info with check in/out times
- save places to google maps
  **View Trip:**
  Users will be able to view their trip broken down by days or view entire trip on one page.

### Technologies

May use Java, SpringBoot, MySQL, Thymeleaf
OR
MERN stack with Handlebars for templating.
-I haven't decided yet.

### What I'll Have to Learn

How to implement Google Maps API, review and relearn a ton of what i've already covered in the class
